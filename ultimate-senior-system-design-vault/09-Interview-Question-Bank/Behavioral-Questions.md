# Behavioral Questions for Senior Engineers

> Senior roles require demonstrating leadership, ownership, and cross-functional impact. Use the STAR framework.

---

## STAR Framework

- **S**ituation — set the context
- **T**ask — what was your responsibility
- **A**ction — what you specifically did (use "I", not "we")
- **R**esult — measurable outcome

---

## Ownership & Reliability

### Q: Tell me about a time you took ownership of a critical production incident.

**What interviewers want to see**:
- You didn't wait for permission
- You communicated clearly under pressure
- You drove root cause analysis (not just fixed symptoms)
- You created lasting fixes / runbooks

**Sample answer structure**:
> "Our checkout service started throwing 5xx errors at 2AM on Black Friday. I was on-call. I immediately paged the team, set up a war room, and...
> Root cause was X. I implemented Y. Traffic recovered in Z minutes. Afterward, I led a blameless post-mortem and we shipped..."

### Q: Describe a time you made a significant technical decision with incomplete information.

**What interviewers want to see**:
- Structured risk analysis
- Stakeholder alignment
- Reversible vs irreversible decisions
- Learning from outcomes

---

### Q: Tell me about a time a project you were responsible for was behind schedule.

**What interviewers want to see**:
- Early detection and communication
- Trade-off decisions (scope cut, resource add)
- Stakeholder management
- Prevention in future projects

---

## Technical Leadership

### Q: How do you approach code reviews as a senior engineer?

**Strong answer themes**:
- Teach, don't dictate
- Focus on design/architecture first, then style
- Acknowledge good work, not just problems
- Separate "must fix" from "nice to have"
- Leave actionable comments

---

### Q: Tell me about a time you had to convince senior leadership to change technical direction.

**What interviewers want to see**:
- Data-driven argument
- Business impact framing (not just technical)
- Handling pushback gracefully
- Building coalitions

---

### Q: Describe how you mentor junior engineers.

**Strong answer themes**:
- Regular 1:1s with goal-setting
- Pairing on complex tasks
- Assigning stretch projects
- Giving specific, timely feedback
- Celebrating growth

---

## Collaboration & Conflict

### Q: Tell me about a time you disagreed with a technical decision made by your team.

**What interviewers want to see**:
- Raised concern constructively with data
- Committed to team decision once made
- Monitored outcome and followed up if needed

---

### Q: How do you work with a team member who isn't delivering?

**Strong answer themes**:
- Direct, private conversation first
- Understand root cause (personal vs skill vs clarity)
- Create clear expectations with timeline
- Escalate to manager if no improvement
- Never complain behind their back

---

### Q: Tell me about a time you worked with a difficult stakeholder.

**What interviewers want to see**:
- Empathy and understanding their perspective
- Finding common ground
- Clear, written communication
- Escalation only as last resort

---

## Scale & Impact

### Q: What is the most impactful engineering improvement you've made?

**Strong answer themes**:
- Quantified impact (latency reduced X%, cost saved $Y, reliability improved to Z%)
- Systemic change, not just a feature
- Others adopted or built on your work

---

### Q: Tell me about a time you simplified something that was overly complex.

**What interviewers want to see**:
- Identified root cause of complexity
- Gained buy-in to change (existing code has inertia)
- Measured improvement

---

### Q: Describe how you balance technical debt vs feature development.

**Strong answer**:
> "I track tech debt as first-class tickets with estimated business impact. I negotiate 20% time each sprint for debt. I prioritize debt that causes incidents or slows velocity the most."

## Values Questions (Amazon Leadership Principles style)

| Principle | Question Pattern |
|-----------|----------------|
| Customer Obsession | Tell me about a time you went above and beyond for a customer |
| Ownership | Describe something that wasn't your job but you fixed anyway |
| Invent & Simplify | Tell me about a time you found a creative/simpler solution |
| Are Right, A Lot | Tell me about a time your judgment was challenged — and you were right |
| Learn & Be Curious | What have you learned recently that changed how you work? |
| Hire and Develop | How have you grown people around you? |
| Insist on Highest Standards | When did you reject work that didn't meet your bar? |
| Think Big | Tell me about your biggest, most ambitious project |
| Bias for Action | Tell me about a time you moved fast with limited information |
| Frugality | How have you done more with less? |
| Earn Trust | How do you build trust with stakeholders? |
| Dive Deep | Tell me about a time you went unusually deep on a problem |
| Backbone | Tell me about a time you disagreed with your manager |
| Deliver Results | What is the highest-impact thing you have shipped? |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Vague answers**: "We improved performance" → say "reduced P99 latency from 800ms to 120ms"
- **Using 'we' only**: Interviewers want to know YOUR contribution specifically
- **Only positive stories**: Include challenges and what you learned
- **Skipping the result**: Always quantify impact if possible
- **Over-engineering the story**: Keep it to 2-3 minutes
